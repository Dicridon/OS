/* lock.c: mutual exclusion
 * If SPIN is false, lock_acquire() should block the calling process until its request can be satisfied
 * Your solution must satisfy the FIFO fairness property
 *
 *  It is assumed that only one process will attempt to initialize a lock,
 *                that processes will call lock_acquire only on an initialized lock
 *                that processes will call lock_release after lock_acquire (and before exiting)
 *                that processes will release a lock before attempting to reacquire it
